# ZIRA
---------

ZIRA is a virtual assistant created by Ansh Choudhary. The assistant uses voice queries and a natural-language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. 

## Usage Examples:
-----------------------
Now you can do the following with the updated ZIRA:
- Send e-mails
- Download songs
- Play songs on Spotify
- Locate a place using Google Maps
- Search on Google directly
- Take notes
- Start a stopwatch
- Have fun conversations with ZIRA
- Ask ZIRA ANYTHING AT ALL!

Say "hi there" (wait for double beep) then...
- "send a mail"
- "download song"
- "take notes"
- "search on Google"
- "locate a place"
- "Play some music" 
- "start stopwatch"
- "Give me menu ideas" 
- "open spotify"
- "what is the meaning of life?"
- "Define [machine learning]"
- "knock knock"
- "Open facebook.com"
- or anything else!

Don't like the name "ZIRA"? Change it to anything you want, like "Jarvis" or "Karen".
